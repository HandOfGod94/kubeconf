# Kubeconf

**WIP**

Kubeconf is a simple wrapper over fzf and kubectl to view configmaps effectively.

## Installation

* On macos
```bash
brew install handofgod94/tap/kubeconf
```

## Quickstart

```bash
kubeconf
```

That's it. It opens up search window with list of configmaps in your current context and current namespace. 
You can search and view the configmap in a search window.
